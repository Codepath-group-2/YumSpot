### App Evaluation

- **Story:** users can search good places to eat, upload and share photos of food, and make appointments to eat out.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app whoever enjoys food and likes to eat out. Sharing photos and talking with friends about food will allow users to have more exciting experience.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how often they are talking about food and eating out.
- **Scope:** First we would start with sharing food interests. We would like to expand to delivery and advertisement features.
